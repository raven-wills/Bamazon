# Bamazon

# Customer
The customer section of Bamazon allows the user to view the product list, and purchase items off of it.
## Customer purchase
The customer is prompted to enter the item_id of the product they would like to purchase. Then they are prompted to select a quantity for that item.

Once they've made their selections, they are told whether that particular product has enough in stock. If there is, the price for their items are calculated and displayed.

# Manager
The manager section is a lot more versatile. It allows the user to view all products, single out products with a stock quantity lower than 5, change stock quantity of any item, and add a new item.


## See products list
The first manager function is exactly the same as it is in the customer's. It displays all products neatly in a table.

## See products that have below 5 items in stock
The user also has the option to single out all items that have a stock quantity low than 5. It will update if the user changes the stock quantity of any item, there is a new item added with low stock, or if the customer purchase function depletes an item below the threshold.
